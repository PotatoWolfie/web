# [BIG IMAGE OF EVERYTHING IN MOD]
**Web** is a mod that expands on spiders by giving them new behaviors and animations. Spiders can now shoot webs to trap players, and baby spiders will hatch from eggs found in Spider Egg Clusters underground. Their attacks and style are inspired by the way _Minecraft Dungeons_ implemented spiders.

The **Spider** was completely overhauled with new animations and behavior changes. First, animations. An Idle, walking, and shooting animation. "Walking" animation is a bit of an overstatement, for the leg animations were unchanged, but the rest of the body does have movement. Second, shooting. Spiders can now shoot webs at players, or any targets it may have. When you are in a web, you are completely stuck for 2 seconds, before getting released. In those two seconds, spiders all sprint at you and attempt to kill you.

The more spiders, the more dangerous. In groups, they work together, with some spiders chasing you, and others shooting webs from a distance. One spider alone will shoot 3 webs max before chasing you for 15 ish seconds, then shoot some more webs.

The **Baby Spider**, coming from **Spider Eggs**, act exactly how the vanilla spiders work. Since they are so young, they can't shoot webs. They can be skeleton jockeys though. Not sure how that one works..

As of now, the only changes that were made to the **Cave Spider** are the animations. More small changes are intended to be added to the Cave Spider.
